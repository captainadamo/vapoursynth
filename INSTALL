Installation
------------

First, a couple of things to note:

* You need to be on Linux or OS X. A BSD might work too.
* You need autotools, probably recent versions.
* You need to have the libraries and headers for libavutil,
  libavcodec, and libswscale installed.
* You need to have either GCC or Clang installed.
  Both a C and C++ compiler are required.
* You need to have Yasm installed.
* You need Python 3 for VSScript and to build the Python module.
* You need to have Cython installed in your Python 3 environment.
* You need Sphinx if you want to build the documentation.

The usual sequence of commands works:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

This will build the core, the Python module, VSScript, vspipe, and all
the plugins that are enabled by default. See ./configure --help.

The documentation can be built using its own Makefile:

    $ make -C doc/ html

The documentation can be installed using the standard program `cp`.


Depending on your operating system's configuration, VapourSynth may not
work out of the box with the default prefix of /usr/local. Two errors
may pop up when running `vspipe --version`:

* "vspipe: error while loading shared libraries: libvapoursynth-script.so.0:
  cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

  This is caused by the non-standard location of libvapoursynth-script.so.0.
  Your dynamic loader is not configured to look in /usr/local/lib. One
  way to work around this error is to use the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
  variable:

    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib vspipe --version

* "Failed to initialize VapourSynth environment"

  This is caused by the non-standard location of the Python module,
  vapoursynth.so. Your Python is not configured to look in
  /usr/local/lib/python3.x/site-packages. One way to work around this
  error is to use the PYTHONPATH environment variable:

    $ PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python3.x/site-packages vspipe --version

  Replace "x" with the correct number.
